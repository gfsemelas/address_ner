# address_ner
Named entity recognition (NER) performed on addresses from Banco Santander database to identify the components of an address.
As NER is a supervised learning algorithm, addresses must be labelled first. This is performed through Azure Maps API (free trial).
This is my final project of MSc Big Data Science - Universidad de Navarra 2020-21.
