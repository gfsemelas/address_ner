# address_ner
Named entity recognition (NER) performed on addresses from Banco Santander database to identify the components of an address.
As NER is a supervised learning algorithm, addresses must be labelled first. This is performed through Azure Maps API (free trial).
This is my final project of MSc Big Data Science - Universidad de Navarra 2020-21.

In "addressner" directory is the code that I run to prepare the data, train and evaluate the NER models and analyze the results.
In "sources" inside "addressner" are some usefull functions I used through all the process.
In "Data" directory are all the data I used and inside the other folders are the data I produced.
